## Notes
Certain files and folders have been excluded from this GitHub respository.
A full list can be found in the .gitignore file, but this includes mainly VS Code and .NET project files.
These were excluded as they are unnecessary, change often due to their auto-generated nature,
and include file paths and other information specific to my setup, and should be replaced to run the project.
